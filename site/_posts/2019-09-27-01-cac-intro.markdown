Welcome to the wonderful world of cryptography and cybersecurity!

In the activities on this website you will learn about cryptography, ciphers, and other great tools we use in cybersecurity.

We need to define some terms we will use throughout our cryptography activities:

 - **ciphertext**: The encryped message that has undergone the cipher encoding process.  The letters might be readable, but are generally nonsense words and jumbles.  We must decrypt the ciphertext to get the plaintext message for the human to read.
 - **plaintext**: The message that is human readable and contains the information we would like to send and receive.  It is the message we send through the encryption process to create the ciphertext.
